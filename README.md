# MTL

Contains Python code to reproduce experiments in the paper "Provable Meta-Learning of Linear Representations", https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.11684. In addition to standard scientific Python dependencies the code leverages the autograd package to compute derivatives and Ray to parallelize experiments.
